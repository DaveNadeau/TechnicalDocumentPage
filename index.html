            <p>Lists are sequence containers that allow constant time insert and erase
              operations anywhere within the sequence, and iteration in both directions.
              List containers are implemented as doubly-linked lists.  Doubly linked lists
              can store each of the elements they contain in different and unrelated storage
              locations. The ordering is kept internally by the association to each element
              of a link to the element preceding it and a link to the element following it.
              Compared to other base standard sequence containers (array, vector and deque),
              lists perform generally better in inserting, extracting and moving elements
              in any position within the container for which an iterator has already been
              obtained, and therefore also in algorithms that make intensive use of these,
              like sorting algorithms.  The main drawback of lists and forward_lists compared
              to these other sequence containers is that they lack direct access to the elements
              by their position; For example, to access the sixth element in a list, one has to
              iterate from a known position (like the beginning or the end) to that position,
              which takes linear time in the distance between these. They also consume some extra
              memory to keep the linking information associated to each element (which may be an
              important factor for large lists of small-sized elements).</p>

              std::list<int> listOfNumbers;<br><br>

              //Inserting elements at end in list <br>
              listOfNumbers.push_back(5);<br>
              listOfNumbers.push_back(6);<br><br>

              //Inserting elements at front in list <br>
              listOfNumbers.push_front(2);<br>
              listOfNumbers.push_front(1);<br><br><br><br>

            <p>Arrays are fixed-size sequence containers: they hold a specific number of
              elements ordered in a strict linear sequence.  Internally, an array does not
              keep any data other than the elements it contains (not even its size, which is a
              template parameter, fixed on compile time). It is as efficient in terms of storage
              size as an ordinary array declared with the language's bracket syntax ([]). This
              class merely adds a layer of member and global functions to it, so that arrays can
              be used as standard containers.  Unlike the other standard containers, arrays have
              a fixed size and do not manage the allocation of its elements through an allocator:
              they are an aggregate type encapsulating a fixed-size array of elements. Therefore,
              they cannot be expanded or contracted dynamically (see vector for a similar container
              that can be expanded).  Zero-sized arrays are valid, but they should not be
              dereferenced (members front, back, and data).  Unlike with the other containers
              in the Standard Library, swapping two array containers is a linear operation that
              involves swapping all the elements in the ranges individually, which generally is a
              considerably less efficient operation. On the other side, this allows the iterators
              to elements in both containers to keep their original container association.  Another
              unique feature of array containers is that they can be treated as tuple objects: The
              array header overloads the get function to access the elements of the array as if it
              was a tuple, as well as specialized tuple_size and tuple_element types.</p>
            <code>
              int n[ 10 ]; // n is an array of 10 integers <br><br>

              // initialize elements of array n to 0<br>
             for ( int i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {<br>
                n[ i ] = i + 100; // set element at location i to i + 100 <br>
             }<br>
             cout << "Element" << setw( 13 ) << "Value" << endl;<br><br>

             // output each array element's value <br>
             for ( int j = 0; j < 10; j++ ) {<br>
                cout << setw( 7 )<< j << setw( 13 ) << n[ j ] << endl;<br>
